&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-glimpse-into-petras-history&#34;&gt;A Glimpse into Petra’s History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petra’s history dates back to the 6th century BCE when the Nabataeans, an ancient Arab people, established the city as a strategic center for trade. Due to its location along major caravan routes, Petra became a prosperous trading city, linking the East and West. The Nabataeans were masterful engineers and architects, building an advanced system of water channels, reservoirs, and roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its peak, Petra was home to an estimated 20,000 people. Its inhabitants crafted beautiful temples, tombs, and monuments, many of which remain carved directly into the rock. As the centuries passed, Petra gradually faded into obscurity, remaining hidden from the outside world until its rediscovery by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1812.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
